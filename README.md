#The Library Commander
Control and manage item reservations through a console-based library management system.

Users of the system are allowed to browse through the resources by features, see if it is available to borrow, if it is not be added to a waitlist, and finally, check out a resource.
Users have a limited time to borrow a resource before they have to check in that same resource/s

The categorical library is managed by different resources ranging from reading/ audio/ video materials. There are also different distributions maintained in the system; those that are circulation-type are freely available to check out and utilize till a certain time-frame, those that are restricted are allowed maximum allotted time (by default 3hrs.), and finally the reference type which means you do not need to check out, but you cannot take outside the console session.

Start the program by beginining the program and follow the prompts.
